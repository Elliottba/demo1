Go back to your project in the terminal/command line.

In your terminal/command line, type git remote add origin [copied web address]

Example: git remote add origin https://github.com/mindplace/test-repo.git

Push your branch to Github: git push origin master

Go back to the folder/repository screen on Github that you just left, and refresh it. 
The title 'Quick setup — if you’ve done this kind of thing before' should disappear, 
and you should see your files there.
